### Avalanche Strategy (Mathematical) 🔥

- **Cons**: May take longer to see first debt paid off

### Snowball Strategy (Psychological) ❄️
- **How it works**: Pay smallest balance debt first
- **Best for**: Users who need motivation and quick wins
- **Example**: If you have a R2,000 personal loan and R15,000 credit card, pay the personal loan first
- **Pros**: Quick psychological wins, builds momentum
- **Cons**: May cost more in total interest

### Hybrid Strategy (Balanced) ⚖️
- **How it works**: Balances interest rate and debt size
- **Best for**: Users who want both mathematical optimization and psychological benefits
