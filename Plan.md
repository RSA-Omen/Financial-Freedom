Plan & options — straight, practical, no fluff

Nice brief. You want a browser-based Financial Freedom planner that shows total debt, lets users commit X rands, recommends where to put it, and simulates cumulative repayments with “freed” payments rolling into the next target. Below I give 3 realistic approaches (pick one), the architecture, data model, core algorithms, UI/UX behaviour, success mapping, and a phase-by-phase roadmap with checkpoints (no ambiguous fluff). I won’t ask questions first — you asked that in your collaboration style, but you also asked for options and a plan; here they are. Pick which option to build and I’ll produce the next-level deliverables and code.

3 options (pick one)
Option A — MVP (fast, deterministic, low complexity) — What I recommend if you want working value quickly

Browser UI: debt list, totals, a “Commit R” input, recommended target (highest APR) and alternate (smallest balance).

Simulation: monthly step simulation assuming monthly compounding; freed payments roll automatically to chosen target or follow simple rule (avalanche by default).

Backend: Flask + MySQL, minimal endpoints to CRUD debts and run simulation.

Outcome: Dashboard + interactive commit + timeline graph + “what-if” slider.

Pros: Fast to build, clear UX, solves primary blocker (visual acknowledgement).
Cons: Simple recommendation logic (no optimization engine).

Option B — Interactive Planner (balanced, better UX + smarter rules)

Everything in A plus:

Two automated recommendation strategies: Avalanche (highest APR) and Snowball (smallest balance) and a hybrid heuristic (APR-adjusted balance).

A “simulate extra payment allocation” breakdown (how commit R is split across debts).

Scenario save/compare (compare current payoff timeline vs. commit applied).

Basic export (CSV) and user accounts.

Pros: Good UX, actionable insights, supports behavior change.
Cons: More development effort than A.

Option C — Optimized Engine (full product)

Everything in B plus:

Optimization engine: constrained optimization (linear programming-like) to minimize total interest paid or payoff time, given monthly cash-flow constraints and business rules (e.g., minimum payments, protected debts).

Sensitivity analysis: show marginal benefit of each extra rand (where you get the most reduction in time/interest).

Personalized recommendations (history-aware), reminders, multi-currency and variable interest compounding rules.

Polish: charts, cohorts, onboarding.

Pros: Best long-term value and retention.
Cons: Most complex; needs stronger QA and validation.

Which I’d pick

If you want something usable quickly that shows users the light at the end of the tunnel: Option A or B. Option B is the sweet spot for product/marketing. Option C if you plan to monetize or scale to many users.

Technical architecture (high-level)

Frontend: React (single-page app). Use Nodus Networks CSS for styling across components (load the Nodus stylesheet and use its utility classes).

Backend: Flask (REST API).

Data store: MySQL (hosted or self-managed).

Auth: JWT (optional for MVP; required for saved scenarios).

Deployment: host static React on CDN + Nginx; Flask on a small server or platform of choice that connects to MySQL. Must be browser-first.

Data model (core tables)

users
id, name, email, password_hash, created_at

debts
id, user_id, name, principal DECIMAL, apr DECIMAL, min_payment DECIMAL, payment_frequency ENUM('monthly','weekly'), compounding ENUM('monthly','daily','none'), start_date, amortization_months (optional), status ENUM('active','paid'), note

payments (history)
id, debt_id, user_id, amount, payment_date, source ENUM('scheduled','one-off','freed'), notes

commitments (user committed extra funds)
id, user_id, amount, created_at, strategy ENUM('avalanche','snowball','custom'), custom_alloc JSON

plan_snapshots
id, user_id, name, snapshot_date, json_state

Keep numbers as DECIMAL to avoid floating point errors.

Core algorithm — monthly step simulation (pseudocode)

This is the single most important piece. Simulation runs month-by-month:

For each active debt:

interest = principal * (apr / 12)

principal = principal + interest

Apply minimum payments (or scheduled payments) to each debt.

Apply committed extra amount (user’s R) according to strategy:

Avalanche: allocate entire extra to highest APR active debt.

Snowball: allocate to smallest balance.

Custom: use custom_alloc percentages.

If a debt gets paid off (principal ≤ 0):

mark status = paid

rollover: add its former monthly payment (min_payment + any extra paid into it) to the pool of available payment amount for the next period (i.e., the freed amount flows automatically per your requirement).

Repeat until all debts status = paid or max horizon reached (e.g., 50 years cap).

Collect per-month totals for UI: total principal remaining, payments made, interest paid.

Notes/assumptions to show users and allow configuration:

Assumed compounding frequency (default monthly).

Payment occurs at the end of period after interest accrual.

Allow users to enter ARMs or changing APRs via editing debt over time (advanced).

Example: commit behavior & indicator

UI flow:

User enters Commit R 2,000.

System runs two quick scenarios side-by-side: (A) put R to highest-APR debt, (B) split proportional to balances.

UI highlights Best immediate ROI (e.g., “Put it to Car Loan — 2.1 years shaved, interest saved R12,000”) and also shows the Behavioral pick (smallest debt) with numbers.

Button: “Apply and simulate full plan” — runs the full monthly simulation and shows timeline and table.

I will show precise numbers in the UI — the backend returns a simulation snapshot with per-month rows and summary metrics (time to zero, total interest).

UI / Pages & Components (React)

Dashboard — overall summary: total debt, monthly outflow, next payoff.

DebtsList — editable list with inline edit (name, principal, apr, min payment).

CommitPanel — commit amount entry, radio for strategy, “Recommend” button.

SimulationViewer — timeline chart (line for balance), stacked area for interest vs principal, payoff milestones.

ScenarioCompare — compare two saved scenarios side-by-side.

Settings — compounding rules, payment frequency default, currency.

Admin (optional) — run analytics and export.

Use Nodus Networks CSS classes for layout and form components. Keep components small and testable.

API endpoints (examples)

POST /api/debts — add debt

GET /api/debts — list debts for user

PUT /api/debts/{id} — edit

POST /api/commit — commit extra funds + strategy — returns allocation suggestion and quick simulation summary

POST /api/simulate — full simulation given current debts + commitment → returns timeseries and metrics

GET /api/plan_snapshots — list saved scenarios

Each simulation call returns minimal payload: months[] {date, total_balance, interest_paid_this_month, payments_this_month, debt_breakdown[]} and top-line summary.

UX decisions & behaviour rules (tell it like it is)

Default recommendation = Avalanche. Statistically minimizes interest paid. Offer Snowball as behaviorally useful (psych wins). Do not hide the reasoning; show math and outcomes.

Always show the “freed payment roll” in the timeline so the user sees snowball effect — this is the morale booster and a legal requirement of your product promise.

Force minimum payments in simulation. User can toggle advanced mode to allow underpayments (dangerous).

Show both time and interest saved — many users like time; others like Rands saved. Give both.

Acceptance / success mapping (how we measure completion)

Dashboard displays total debt and per-debt status. ✅

Commit flow accepts R and shows a single recommended target and an alternate (clear rationale). ✅

Simulation engine returns months-to-zero timeline reflecting rolled-over payments. ✅

Insight panel lists top 3 debts to target and shows estimated interest/time saved if targeted. ✅

When these items are working for a test user with 5 debts, consider the product complete for MVP.

Phase roadmap & checkpoints (no calendar durations — milestones only)

Phase 1 — Specs & wireframes (Checkpoint 1)

Deliver: detailed wireframe of Dashboard, Commit panel, Simulation viewer; API contract; DB schema.

You verify visuals and pick Option A/B/C.

Phase 2 — Backend simulation & DB (Checkpoint 2)

Deliver: Flask endpoints for CRUD debts and /simulate with test dataset and automated unit tests for simulation correctness.

Checkpoint: run simulation for a sample dataset and validate results.

Phase 3 — Frontend (Checkpoint 3)

Deliver: React UI connected to backend for CRUD and commit flow; Nodus CSS applied; basic charts (matplotlib-equivalent is for backend — frontend will use chart library).

Checkpoint: interactive commit flow works for sample user.

Phase 4 — Polish & insights (Checkpoint 4)

Deliver: scenario compare, insights panel, export CSV, acceptance tests.

Final acceptance: all success criteria green.

After you approve Phase 1 deliverables, I’ll produce API specs and either a mocked React component or full code for the chosen option.

Implementation notes & gotchas (practical, blunt)

Data correctness matters. Users will enter wrong APR formats, and mistakes here break the simulation. Validate APR, frequency, and ensure principal >= 0.

Edge cases: zero-interest loans, negative amortization, interest-only loans — handle explicitly or reject with clear message.

Rounding: use DECIMAL types and round only for display; do not round intermediate values.

Performance: month-by-month simulation is cheap for a single user. If you run thousands of scenarios server-side, move to batched jobs.

UX pitfalls: avoid overwhelming the user with optimization jargon. Provide a “Quick mode” that hides advanced knobs.
