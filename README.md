# Financial Freedom Platform

A comprehensive debt management platform that helps users visualize their path to financial freedom by tracking multiple debts, comparing repayment strategies (Avalanche vs Snowball vs Hybrid), and showing the impact of extra payments on debt-free timelines.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Financial Freedom"
   ```

2. **Start the platform**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5006
   - Database: localhost:6001

### First Time Setup

1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. Click "Add Your First Debt" to start tracking
3. Enter your debt details (name, balance, APR, minimum payment)
4. Explore different repayment strategies
5. See the impact of extra payments on your timeline

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Services
- **Frontend (React)**: Port 3001 - User interface with Nodus design theme
- **Backend (Flask)**: Port 5006 - REST API with MCP/AI integration
- **Database (MySQL)**: Port 6001 - Data persistence with DECIMAL precision
- **Nginx**: Port 80 - Reverse proxy (optional)

### Key Features
- **Dashboard**: Total debt overview with months-to-zero tracking
- **Debt Management**: Add, edit, delete debts with validation
- **Strategy Comparison**: Avalanche, Snowball, and Hybrid strategies
- **Extra Payment Calculator**: Real-time impact analysis
- **Visual Charts**: Timeline, balance trends, and payment breakdowns
- **Insights Panel**: Personalized recommendations and ROI analysis

## üìä Repayment Strategies

### Avalanche Strategy (Mathematical)
- Targets highest APR debt first
- Minimizes total interest paid
- Best for math-focused users

### Snowball Strategy (Psychological)
- Targets smallest balance first
- Provides quick wins and motivation
- Best for motivation-focused users

### Hybrid Strategy (Balanced)
- APR-adjusted balance heuristic
- Combines math and psychology
- Best for balanced approach

## üîß Development

### Backend API
All backend functions are exposed as REST APIs for MCP/AI agent integration:

```bash
# Debt Management
GET    /api/debts              # List all debts
POST   /api/debts              # Create new debt
PUT    /api/debts/:id          # Update debt
DELETE /api/debts/:id          # Delete debt

# Calculations
POST   /api/calculate/simulate          # Run full simulation
POST   /api/calculate/avalanche         # Calculate avalanche strategy
POST   /api/calculate/snowball          # Calculate snowball strategy
POST   /api/calculate/hybrid            # Calculate hybrid strategy
POST   /api/calculate/compare           # Compare all strategies
POST   /api/calculate/impact            # Calculate extra payment impact

# Insights
GET    /api/insights/recommend          # Get recommended debt target
GET    /api/insights/top-targets        # Get top 3 debt targets
GET    /api/insights/marginal-benefit   # ROI per extra rand

# Analytics
POST   /api/analytics/timeline          # Timeline data for charts
POST   /api/analytics/balance-trend     # Balance over time
```

### Database Schema
- **debts**: Core debt information with DECIMAL precision
- **payments**: Payment history tracking
- **commitments**: Extra payment tracking
- **plan_snapshots**: Scenario comparison

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main overview with debt cards and charts
- **DebtForm**: Add/edit debt with validation
- **StrategyComparison**: Side-by-side strategy analysis
- **CommitPanel**: Extra payment impact calculator
- **InsightsPanel**: Recommendations and ROI analysis

## üé® Design System

Built with **Nodus Design System** featuring:
- Professional matte carbon fiber aesthetic
